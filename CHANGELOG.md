## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Coaching & Goals Stabilization

### Added
- **Personalized coaching plan** — `GET /api/v1/users/me/coaching-plan` returns a rule-based coaching plan derived from the user's practice history (focus area, current level, weekly goal, recommended practice mode/question, action steps, metrics to watch, next milestone). Optional AI-powered coaching note when `PITCHPILOT_AI_API_KEY` is configured.
- **Goals CRUD** — `GET /api/v1/users/me/goals`, `POST /api/v1/users/me/goals`, `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/goals/{id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/me/goals/{id}` with full user isolation. Goals track title, target metric, target value, current value, status (`active` | `completed` | `abandoned`), and `completed_at` timestamp.
- **React `/coaching-plan` page** — Protected route with animated cards for focus area, weekly goal, action steps, next milestone, recommended practice, and AI coaching note. Includes inline goal creation form, progress bars, complete/delete actions, and active/completed goal filtering.
- **Mobile `CoachingPlanCard`** — Reusable glass-morphism card on Home and Settings screens. Handles logged-out (login prompt), loading, error, and success states. Deep-links to Practice with the recommended mode and question.
- **Backend tests** — `tests/test_coaching_plan_and_goals.py` adds 17 tests covering coaching plan auth, beginner state, weakness reflection, goals CRUD, update/delete 404s, and cross-user isolation for goals, sessions, and reports.
- **Full-system QA doc** — `docs/FULL_SYSTEM_QA_V1_3.md` with automated command checklist, endpoint coverage matrix, user isolation scenarios, React/mobile static verification, known limitations, and v1.4.0 roadmap.

### Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` — adds sidebar link to `/coaching-plan`.
- `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` — adds "Coaching Plan" nav item with `authOnly: true`.
- `mobile/src/app/index.tsx` — renders `<CoachingPlanCard />` on the Home screen.
- `mobile/src/app/settings.tsx` — renders `<CoachingPlanCard compact />` in the account area.

### Fixed
- `api/schemas.py` — `GoalUpdateRequest.status` pattern corrected to `^(active|completed|abandoned)$`.
- `api/main.py` — all coaching plan and goals endpoints correctly require `Depends(get_current_user)`.

### Production Cleanup (Task 49)
- **React code splitting** — `DashboardPage`, `HistoryPage`, `FeedbackPage`, `CoachingPlanPage`, and `SettingsPage` are now loaded via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`. Added `LoadingScreen` component with "Loading PitchPilot AI..." fallback. Main production chunk reduced from ~779 kB to ~363 kB; Vite chunk-size warning eliminated.
- **FastAPI lifespan migration** — Replaced deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")` with `contextlib.asynccontextmanager` lifespan context manager. Startup behavior (`config.ensure_dirs()` + `init_db()`) is unchanged. pytest deprecation warnings eliminated.

### Docker & Cloud Deployment (Task 50–51)
- **Docker deployment verified** — `docker-compose.prod.yml` validated, API and web images built and tested. Endpoints confirmed working: `/health`, `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/dashboard/stats`, `/api/v1/users/me/coaching-plan`, `/api/v1/users/me/goals`, `/api/v1/users/me/analytics`, `/api/v1/users/me/profile`.
- **`.dockerignore` updated** — Excludes frontend/mobile node_modules, dist, .expo, uploads, media, databases, and cache directories.
- **`docs/DEPLOYMENT_WEB_API.md` updated** — Added v1.3.0 protected endpoints, Docker verification commands, first-build-slow troubleshooting.
- **Cloud deployment planning documentation added** — New `docs/CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` covers VPS + Docker Compose (recommended), Render, Railway, Fly.io, and AWS/GCP/Azure high-level options. Includes architecture diagram, environment variables, Ubuntu deployment commands, HTTPS setup (Caddy/nginx/Cloudflare), backup strategy, and production safety checklist.

### VPS Production Package (Task 52)
- **`docker-compose.vps.yml`** — New production compose file with integrated Caddy reverse proxy (automatic HTTPS), API container (internal 8000), and web container (internal 80). Only ports 80/443 are exposed publicly.
- **`deployment/Caddyfile`** — Ready-to-use Caddy config with placeholder domains, reverse proxy routes, security headers, compression, and request body size limits.
- **Backup scripts** — `scripts/backup_sqlite.sh` (container-safe SQLite backup with auto-cleanup), `scripts/backup_uploads.sh` (volume tar.gz backup), `scripts/restore_sqlite.sh` (interactive restore with confirmation).
- **`scripts/deploy_vps.sh`** — One-command deployment helper that pulls git changes, validates compose, builds/starts containers, waits for health, and shows status.
- **`.env.production.example`** — Added `PUBLIC_WEB_DOMAIN` and `PUBLIC_API_DOMAIN` for deployment script integration.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Authentication Release

### Added
- **User accounts** — email + password registration and login endpoints (`POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/logout`, `GET /auth/me`) with `bcrypt` password hashing (passwords never persisted in plaintext)
- **JWT auth (HS256)** — signed access tokens issued by the API, verified via a shared `Depends(get_current_user)` dependency; token lifetime configurable via `PITCHPILOT_JWT_EXPIRES_MINUTES` (default 24 h)
- **User-scoped sessions** — `sessions` table gains a `user_id` FK; every read/write filters by the caller's id so User A cannot see, modify, export, or delete User B's data
- **Protected endpoints** — `POST /api/v1/analyze/full`, `GET/DELETE /api/v1/sessions[/{id}]`, `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats`, `GET /api/v1/reports/{session_id}/{html,csv}` now require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Public endpoints preserved** — `GET /health`, `GET /`, and all `GET /api/v1/questions/…` routes stay open so the Practice page loads before login
- **React auth** — `AuthProvider` + `useAuth()` context, `<ProtectedRoute>` guard, `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage`, session-expired banner; JWT persisted in `localStorage` under `pitchpilot_auth_token`; shared API client auto-attaches the header via `setAuthTokenProvider` and logs users out on any 401
- **Mobile auth** — Expo `AuthContext` mirrors the web behavior with `AsyncStorage` persistence, premium dark Login/Register screens, and a Logout action in Settings; `pitchpilotApi.ts` injects `Authorization` on `apiFetch` and `analyzeFullVideo` and clears storage on 401
- **Config** — `PITCHPILOT_JWT_SECRET` and `PITCHPILOT_JWT_EXPIRES_MINUTES` in `.env.example` and `.env.production.example`; production API refuses to boot with the default insecure secret
- **Docs** — new `docs/AUTH_QA_CHECKLIST.md`, expanded auth sections in `README.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT_WEB_API.md`
- **Tests** — `tests/test_auth.py` covers registration, login, `/auth/me`, wrong password, duplicate email, expired/invalid tokens, and cross-user session isolation

### Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/PracticePage.tsx` — modes/questions now load for guests; **Run Full Analysis** redirects to `/login` with an inline message when the user is unauthenticated instead of blocking the whole page
- `mobile/src/api/pitchpilotApi.ts` — `analyzeFullVideo` now takes a platform-aware asset (`File` on Expo web, `{ uri, name, type }` on native) and always appends `question`, `role` (defaults to `General`), and `save_session`; backend error `detail` is surfaced in the UI instead of the generic `HTTP 400`
- `mobile/src/app/practice.tsx` — filters mode ids containing `/` (e.g. `AI/ML Interview`) so a single unmapped mode never blanks the screen; drops the client-side "role required" hard-error since the client now falls back to `General`

### Fixed
- Practice page no longer shows `Failed to load practice modes.` for unauthenticated visitors (public endpoints stay public)
- Mobile web `POST /api/v1/analyze/full` no longer returns `400 Bad Request` — the multipart body now carries a real filename on both web (`File` / typed `Blob`) and native (`{ uri, name, type }`)

### Security
- Passwords hashed with `bcrypt` (cost factor from `passlib` default)
- JWTs signed with HS256 using `PITCHPILOT_JWT_SECRET`; production start-up hard-fails on the placeholder secret
- CORS behavior unchanged: `PITCHPILOT_ENV=production` still refuses `*`

### Mobile Polish Release

### Added
- **Premium mobile UI redesign** — Dark navy SaaS aesthetic with cyan/blue accents, glass cards, gradient buttons, score ring, and custom bottom tab navigation
- **Safe-area and scroll fixes** — `paddingBottom: 100` on all screens to clear tab bar; iOS home indicator support (`paddingBottom: 24`, height `84`)
- **Keyboard avoidance** — Practice screen wraps ScrollView in `KeyboardAvoidingView` so the Target Role input stays visible when typing
- **Web preview centering** — `_layout.tsx` renders the app in a centered `maxWidth: 480` container on desktop browsers
- **Report export / share** — Feedback and History screens now use `expo-sharing` + `expo-file-system` for real native share sheets (web triggers browser download)
- **Settings persistence** — Save Practice History and Speech Analysis toggles are stored in AsyncStorage and survive app restarts
- **Save Practice History wired to backend** — Mobile sends `save_session` boolean to `POST /api/v1/analyze/full`; backend respects it and skips SQLite save when false
- **AI Interview coming-soon badge** — Purple "Soon" badge on the AI Interview tab; tapping it shows a friendly Alert instead of pretending to work
- **Speech Analysis toggle rename** — Formerly "Real-time Audio Analysis" (misleading); now accurately labeled "Speech Analysis" with helper text explaining it analyzes uploaded video audio
- **Mobile screenshot checklist** — `portfolio/MOBILE_SCREENSHOT_CHECKLIST.md` with 6 required shots, capture instructions, and DevTools viewport recommendations
- **Mobile screenshot folder docs** — `portfolio/screenshots/mobile/README.md` with expected filenames, sizes, and security reminders

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` with Mobile App Preview section and placeholder screenshot paths
- Updated `mobile/README.md` with premium UI overview, settings/export explanations, and known limitations

  - Dashboard with pull-to-refresh, KPI grid, skill bars, and recent sessions
  - History with session list, detail view, report export, and delete
  - Settings for backend URL and connection test
- **Save-to-history flow** — `POST /api/v1/analyze/full` automatically saves completed sessions to SQLite and returns `session_id`
- **Graceful save failure** — if database write fails, analysis still completes with `session_id: null` and `save_warning`
- **Multi-platform QA checklist** (`docs/MULTIPLATFORM_QA_CHECKLIST.md`) covering Streamlit, React, Mobile, and Backend

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` with multi-platform architecture diagram and run commands for all four surfaces
- Updated `mobile/README.md` with detailed backend URL matrix for emulator and physical phone
- Updated `portfolio/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` to reflect web app, mobile app, and API backend support
