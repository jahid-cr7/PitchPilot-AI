## 4. Frontend Checks (React)

### 4.1 Build (Post-Cleanup)
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```
**Result:** ✅ Success (`dist/` generated, 3.10 s)

> Bundle split via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`. Main `index.js` reduced from ~779 kB to ~363 kB. No chunk-size warnings.

### 4.2 Static Verification Checklist

| Requirement | Verification Method | Status |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Logged-out user sees Login/Register | `App.tsx` routes `/login` and `/register` outside `<ProtectedRoute>`; `AuthContext` boots with `isAuthenticated=false` | ✅ Verified |
| Logged-in user can upload video | `PracticePage.tsx` mounts for authenticated users; upload form visible | ✅ Verified |
| Analysis saves `session_id` | `FeedbackPage.tsx` reads `session_id` from analysis result; backend `POST /api/v1/analyze/full` returns it | ✅ Verified |
| Dashboard updates | `DashboardPage.tsx` fetches `/api/v1/dashboard/stats` on mount; reactive state | ✅ Verified |
| History updates | `HistoryPage.tsx` fetches `/api/v1/sessions` on mount; delete refreshes list | ✅ Verified |
| Coaching plan page loads | `/coaching-plan` route exists in `App.tsx` and is wrapped in `<ProtectedRoute>` | ✅ Verified |
| Goals can be created/completed/deleted | `CoachingPlanPage.tsx` implements create form, complete button (`updateGoal`), and delete button (`deleteGoal`) | ✅ Verified |
| Logout clears token | `AuthContext.logout` removes `pitchpilot_auth_token` and `pitchpilot_auth_user` from `localStorage` | ✅ Verified |

---

## 5. Mobile Checks (Expo)

### 5.1 TypeScript
```bash
cd mobile && npx tsc --noEmit
```
**Result:** ✅ Passed (zero type errors)

### 5.2 Static Verification Checklist

| Requirement | Verification Method | Status |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Login/register works | `AuthContext` uses `loginUser`/`registerUser` from `authApi`; persists to `AsyncStorage` | ✅ Verified |
| Home loads | `app/index.tsx` is the default tab; renders hero, stats, and `CoachingPlanCard` | ✅ Verified |
| Practice upload works | `app/practice.tsx` uses `analyzeFullVideo` with multipart body; mode/question selectors present | ✅ Verified |
| Feedback works | `app/feedback.tsx` displays score ring, dimension scores, and export actions | ✅ Verified |
| Settings logout works | `app/settings.tsx` calls `logout()` from `AuthContext` | ✅ Verified |
| Coaching plan card loads | `CoachingPlanCard.tsx` fetches `getCoachingPlan()`; handles loading/error/success states | ✅ Verified |
| Logged-out user sees coaching login prompt | `CoachingPlanCard` returns login prompt when `!isAuthenticated` | ✅ Verified |

## 6. Known Limitations

1. **Speech model download** — First-run speech analysis still requires a ~150 MB faster-whisper model download. No change in this release.
2. **Camera detector accuracy** — Haar Cascade remains fast but less accurate than deep-learning detectors in poor lighting.
3. **AI Coach offline default** — Rule-based fallback is used when no `PITCHPILOT_AI_API_KEY` is configured. LLM-powered coaching requires an external API key.
4. **No cloud sync** — SQLite is local-only; there is no backup or multi-device sync.
5. **Mobile goals UI** — Goals CRUD is surfaced on the React web app (`/coaching-plan`). The mobile app has read-only coaching plan display via `CoachingPlanCard`; full goal management on mobile is a v1.4.0 candidate.
6. **No end-to-end browser tests** — React and mobile verification in this report is static/code-review based. Full E2E with Playwright or Detox is planned for v1.4.0.

## 7. Production Cleanup (Task 49)

The following cleanup was performed after the initial QA pass:

| Item | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| React bundle size | `React.lazy` + `Suspense` for Dashboard, History, Feedback, CoachingPlan, Settings pages; added `LoadingScreen` fallback | Main chunk reduced from ~779 kB to ~363 kB; chunk warning eliminated |
| FastAPI startup | Replaced `@app.on_event("startup")` with `contextlib.asynccontextmanager` lifespan | Deprecation warnings eliminated from test output |

## 8. Docker Deployment Verification (Task 50)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config   # ✅ Validated
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d  # ✅ Built & started
```

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `GET http://localhost:8000/health` | ✅ `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET http://localhost:3000` | ✅ HTTP 200 |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | ✅ Returns access_token + user |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | ✅ Returns access_token + user |
| `GET /api/v1/dashboard/stats` (with Bearer) | ✅ Empty stats for new user |
| `GET /api/v1/users/me/coaching-plan` | ✅ Beginner plan returned |
| `GET /api/v1/users/me/goals` | ✅ Empty goals list |
| `GET /api/v1/users/me/analytics` | ✅ Empty analytics |
| `GET /api/v1/users/me/profile` | ✅ Profile with user data |

### Docker files verified

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `Dockerfile.api` | ✅ Verified | Python 3.12-slim, ffmpeg/libgl1, requirements, exposes 8000, uvicorn CMD |
| `frontend/Dockerfile` | ✅ Verified | Node multi-stage build, nginx static serve, SPA fallback, VITE_API_BASE_URL arg |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | ✅ Verified | api + web services, named volumes for SQLite + uploads, healthcheck dependency |
| `.env.production.example` | ✅ Verified | All required vars documented with safe defaults |
| `.dockerignore` | ✅ Updated | Added frontend/mobile node_modules, dist, .expo, .streamlit |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT_WEB_API.md` | ✅ Updated | v1.3.0 endpoints, Docker verification commands, first-build-slow note |

---

## 9. Next Technical Roadmap (v1.4.0+)

| Priority | Item | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| High | **End-to-end browser tests** (Playwright) | Close the gap between static analysis and runtime behavior |
| High | **Mobile goals CRUD** | Parity with web coaching plan page |
| Medium | **Real-time practice mode** | Live webcam + mic feedback without upload |
| Low | **Deep-learning body language** | MediaPipe/BlazePose for better camera analysis |
| Low | **Team dashboard** | Aggregated org-wide coaching stats |
