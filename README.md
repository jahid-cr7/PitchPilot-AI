## Startup-Style UI

PitchPilot AI features a polished, SaaS-style interface designed for portfolio demos and company interviews:

- **Gradient hero section** with clear CTAs
- **Step indicators** for the guided practice workflow
- **Styled metric cards** with soft shadows and hover effects
- **Status badges** (MVP, Offline Fallback, API-Ready, Ethical Practice Tool)
- **Professional empty states** with action suggestions
- **Section cards** with borders and consistent spacing
- **Responsive layout** that works on desktop and mobile

The UI uses custom CSS injected safely via Streamlit and follows modern SaaS design patterns.

## How It Works

1. **Upload** an MP4 video on the **Practice** page.
2. **Run analyses** — Video (motion), Camera (face presence), Speech (transcription).
3. **Review feedback** on the **Feedback** page with per-dimension metrics.
4. **Run AI Coach** — Enter the interview question and target role. The AI evaluates your transcript for structure, relevance, and clarity.
5. **Generate final score** — Combines all scores into an overall rating with strengths, weak points, and a next practice task.
6. **Save session** — Stores everything in SQLite for history and trend tracking.
7. **Export** — Download HTML or CSV reports from the **History** page.

## Installation

### Ubuntu

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jahid-cr7/PitchPilot-AI.git
cd PitchPilot-AI

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

### Windows

```powershell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jahid-cr7/PitchPilot-AI.git
cd PitchPilot-AI

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 3. Activate it
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## How to Use Demo Mode

Perfect for interviews, presentations, or testing without a real video:

1. Open the app and go to the **Home** page.
2. Click **"🚀 Load Demo Data"**.
3. Navigate to **Feedback** to see sample analysis results.
4. Explore the **Dashboard** for trend charts.
5. Visit **History** to view how sessions are stored and exported.

---

## How to Use a Real AI API Key

The AI Coach works out of the box in **fallback (rule-based) mode**. To enable real AI-powered analysis:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible provider.
2. Set the environment variable before running the app:

```bash
export PITCHPILOT_AI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export PITCHPILOT_AI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"   # optional
export PITCHPILOT_AI_BASE_URL=""            # optional, for custom providers
```

3. Restart the app. The AI Coach will now call the LLM API instead of using rule-based scoring.

## Ethical Use Note

PitchPilot AI is designed as a **practice and self-improvement tool only**.

- Use it to rehearse and refine your skills ahead of time.
- Do **not** use this tool during live interviews or assessments.
- The goal is to build genuine confidence, not to bypass evaluation.

---

## Current Limitations

- Speech analysis requires a local faster-whisper model download on first run (~150 MB).
- Camera analysis uses Haar Cascade (fast but less accurate than deep-learning detectors).
- AI Coach requires an external API key for LLM-powered analysis; otherwise uses rule-based fallback.
- No user authentication or multi-user support in the MVP.
- Video analysis is limited to MP4 format.

---

## Future Improvements

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full roadmap. Highlights:

- Real AI provider integration with prompt versioning
- Enhanced speech analytics (sentiment, emotion, pause analysis)
- Deep-learning body language analysis (MediaPipe, BlazePose)
- User accounts and authentication
- FastAPI backend for API access
- Docker & cloud deployment
- Team dashboard for coaching organizations

## Interview Talking Points

**If you have 30 seconds:**
> "PitchPilot AI is a Python/Streamlit app that analyzes practice interview videos. It evaluates body language, camera presence, speech clarity, and answer content — then gives you a score and actionable feedback. It works offline for most features and has a demo mode for quick testing."

**If you have 2 minutes:**
> "I built PitchPilot AI as an MVP to solve a real problem: people struggle to get objective feedback on their interview performance. The app takes an MP4 video, runs OpenCV for motion and face detection, faster-whisper for transcription, and an LLM for content analysis. If no API key is available, it gracefully falls back to rule-based scoring. Everything is stored in SQLite so users can track progress over time. The architecture is modular — each analyzer is independent, so I can swap in better models later without rewriting the UI."
